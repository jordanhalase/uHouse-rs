# μHouse-rs

Written by Jordan Halase

This is a rewrite of [μHouse](https://github.com/jordanhalase/uHouse) in Rust.

Displays a 3D rendered wireframe of a basic house scene with a tree and car on an SSD1306 OLED display with Arduino.

Transforms 57 fixed point vertices and rasterizes 68 lines in real time on an Atmega328P at 16MHz.
